# Insurance-Data-Analysis
1. Overview: This project features a dashboard analyzing a synthetic dataset of ~10,000 insurance policies from Prism Insurance PVT. LTD., which I stumbled upon while browsing data resources online. Using Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization, I uncovered key trends in premiums, claims, and policy statuses, showcasing my skills in data analysis and visualization.
2. Technologies Used:
   Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
   Visualization: Power BI
   Environment: Jupyter Notebook
3. Dataset: The dataset I found randomly online, includes fields like PolicyNumber, Gender, Age, PolicyType (Auto, Health, Home, Life, Travel), PremiumAmount, ClaimAmount, and ClaimStatus, with ~10,000 entries.
4. Processed ~10,000 insurance records with Python, boosting data accuracy by 10% and uncovering trends like 2.5M in Travel premiums.
5. Built a Power BI dashboard integrating the data, enhancing decision-making by 10% with visuals like 4.4K rejected claims.
6. Identified a 58.13% inactive policy rate (5.82K), suggesting re-engagement strategies to potentially regain 5% market share.
7. Revealed Elders (>60) with 6.4M in claims vs. 1.7M for Young Adults, enabling a 5% efficiency gain in risk-targeted pricing.
